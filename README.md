# MemoryTiles
## Purpose

The Memory Tiles is a game that I made during the second year at university. The application was designed to be a replica of this game https://webgamesonline.com/memory/.

## Technology used

The application was developed using C# and WPF.

## Features

The game has a login page where the user can choose an existing profile or create a new one. After pressing the Play button, a menu is opened. Here he can choose to play a new game (with the default size of the board 5X5) by pressing the New Game button. Also the user can choose to see his statistics, to change the board size or to exit the game. The actual game has 3 levels to beat. If the user beats all 3 levels, the game is considered won and the statistics will change. Also, inside the game, the user has the possibility to save the progress or to open an existing game (previously saved as a JSON file).
